# WebSharper.Google.Visualization

Provides WebSharper™ bindings to the [Google
Visualization](https://developers.google.com/chart/) library that
provides rich, interactive charts and other data visualizations
that run in the browser. It supports many common chart type
sincluding image and interactive charts, maps, and data
tables. The complete list of examples can be found at the Google
Chart Tools
[Gallery](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery).

The visualizations run in all modern JavaScript-enabled
browsers. Some of the visualizations may require Adobe® Flash®
Player for rendering.

With the Google Visualization WebSharper™ Extensions you can develop
WebSharper applications that use the Google Visualization API using
nothing but F# code.

See the [Examples page](docs/Examples.md) to learn how to use
Google Visualization with WebSharper. Also check out the
[screenshots](docs/Screenshots.md) for some example
visualizations.
