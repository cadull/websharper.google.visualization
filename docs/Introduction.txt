% Introduction

**Add great-looking visualizations to your web applications!
...Without a single line of JavaScript.**

Google Chart Tools is a client-side JavaScript library that provides
rich, interactive charts and other data visualizations that run in the
browser.  It supports many common chart types including image and
interactive charts, maps, and data tables.  The complete list of
examples can be found at the Google Chart Tools
[Gallery][gvis-gallery].

The visualizations run in all modern JavaScript-enabled browsers.
Some of the visualizations may require Adobe® Flash® Player for
rendering.

With the Google Visualization WebSharper™ Extensions you can develop
WebSharper™ applications that use the Google Visualization API using
nothing but F# code.
